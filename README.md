# Find-A-Film

## Motivations

Have you ever spent too long thinking or searching for films to watch, but can't ever find anything that you're in the mood for? Find-A-Film aims to address this problem and make film discovery easier, saving you from endlessly scouring and giving you more time watching! The basic idea is this: enter a film that has a similar vibe to the ideal movie you'd like to watch. The application will then make use of AI to generate suggestions based on how well they match the given film according to several ranking criteria (e.g. theme, time period, style, etc.).
